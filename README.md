# Ocular Disease Detection

This project uses a deep learning model to classify ocular (eye) diseases from medical images. The goal is to assist in early detection and improve diagnosis accuracy using AI.

## 🔍 Features

- Image-based classification of eye diseases
- Custom CNN model built with TensorFlow/Keras
- High accuracy on test data
- Clean and modular code
- Jupyter Notebooks for training and evaluation

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used contains labeled ocular disease images, likely based on the ODIR dataset or a similar source. (Update this line with the exact dataset name and source if known.)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy / Pandas
- OpenCV / Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
